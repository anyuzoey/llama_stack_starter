    "# Very simple draft of LlamaStack Max Tool Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This script tests how well LlamaStack handles increasing numbers of tools by measuring **tool selection accuracy, execution success, and latency**. \n",
    "## Experiment Setup\n",
    "- **5 Real Tools**: Weather info, word count, string reversal, uppercase conversion, insurance scoring.\n",
    "- **Fake Tools**: Dynamically generated tools with random outputs (up to 40 additional tools).\n",
    "- **5 Fixed Queries**: Each mapped to a ground truth tool.\n",
    "- **Scaling**: Start with 5 tools, increase by 5 up to 45.\n",
    "- **Metrics Logged**:\n",
    "  - Exception Rate (how many exception occurs out of 5 queries)\n",
    "  - Tool Execution Success Rate (how many time tools are actually executed out of 5 queries)\n",
    "  - Correct Tool Selection Rate  (how many time correct tool is selected out of 5 queries)\n",
    "  - Average Latency (average time taken to respond 5 queries)\n"
